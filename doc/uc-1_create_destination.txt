UC-1: Create destination

  To simulate the properties of an output-based system, funds are going 
  to be locked with a m-of-m multisig script, based on a key from the
  the seller and a new and unique key from an oracle. The oracle will
  allow only one single signing operation to ensure no funds from the
  locked destination are double-spent.

  This use-case describes the process of creating a 2-of-2 multisig
  script destination.

Scope:
  Swap client

Level:
  User-goal

Primary actor:
  Seller

Supporting actor:
  Oracle

Preconditions:

  1. The seller configured the system's settings to connect to a running Bitcoin or Omni Core RPC server
  2. The seller configured the system's settings to connect to a running oracle server

Main success scenario:

  1. The seller requests to generate a new lock-destination
  2. The seller provides a public key
  3. The system requests a new public key from the oracle
  4. The oracle generates a new and unique key-pair
  5. The oracle returns the corresponding public key
  6. Both keys are sorted
  7. The system creates a 2-of-2 multisig script, based on the sorted public keys
  8. The system returns the oracle's public key as `identifier`, and the `destination`, consisting of `address`, `pubkeys`, `redeemScript`, `reqSigs` and `type`

Extensions:

  2a. The seller doesn't provide a public key
      1. The system generates a new public key for the seller

Success guarantee:

  1. The oracle generated a new and unique key-pair
  2. The system generated a 2-of-2 multisig script based on the seller's and oracle's public keys
