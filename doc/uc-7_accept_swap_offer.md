UC-7: Accept swap offer
-----------------------

  A buyer finalizes the atomic swap by adding one or more inputs to the
  swap offer transaction, carrying enough value to pay for the payment
  output, and by adding a payload and reference output to the
  transaction, to transfer the tokens to the buyer. A change output can
  optionally be added. Once the transaction is signed, it can be
  broadcasted, which "executes" the swap, transfering bitcoins to the
  seller, and tokens to the buyer.

  This use-case describes the process of accepting an atomic swap offer
  and finalizing the trade.
